# Sororitas backpack


### About

This is designed (by me) to be laser cut in 3mm mdf  
This could still be used for other methods (such as EVA foam) if you simply ignore the tabs for the laser cut pieces to slide into each other  
and cut a bevel on the pieces, I was originally going to make it from EVA but decided later on to use MDF

These files are only for the main body of the backpack and some greebles. For the top tube/spheres I used 100mm "PVC ventilation ducting" (which is not the same as PVC sewer pipes, they have thinner walls and are therefor slighly smaller and also ligther). for the spheres I used 150mm foam spheres

### Laser settings

These SVG files should have a pretty straight forward pattern, single layer files, divided by color  
red   = cut   
blue  = score  
black = engrave 

### Files

These files were all designed for my personal laser cutter, which has a 370x370mm cutting surface and arranged to use 4 sheets of that.  
all placed in ./vector_files/export

the raw mockup design, including the watermarked reference pic I used is in ./vector_files/source/ 

### Assembly

Assembly of these pieces is docemented in the ./build_pics/ folder 

it is mostly just glued together with PVA glue, I added some scrap pieces of wood for added stability of a few pieces, since joining mdf panels at angles other then 90Â° is a hazzle I left small gaps in those places, glued broken popsicle sticks to the back of those joints and then filled in the gaps (popsicle sticks are just there to provide a backing for the filler) 

After glueing it up and fillings gaps I sanded it quite a lot, went over all seams with filler and sanded those down so the tabs wouldn't be visible


### Some notes

Some parts of the design don't have tabs to join pieces together, that is simply because I didn't spend the time to work out how to design matching the tabs to the other pieces at strange angles, tabs would be good to have but I was feeling lazy

The wooden pieces weigh together around 600 grams in my case 

The back side of the backpack has 5 openings, 4 for backpack straps to pass through and one in the middle to be able to access the inside of the pack. the middle one also has a "hatch" with 4 holes that correspond to 4 holes in the back itself for some yet to be thought of improvised mechanism to keep it closed, will most likely just be some pieces of string, the back shouldn't really be visible often
